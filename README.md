# JavaScript Small Problems #

This is a collection of a bunch of small JavaScript problems that I’ve
completed over the period of several months. The problems were simple and
small, hence the name “JavaScript Small Problems.” Feel free to browse and
email me at <mailto:john@johnisom.dev> if you have any questions.

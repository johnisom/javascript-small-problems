// Exercise 1

/*

The key for an object when defined in an object literal must be either a
string or a valid identifier. In this example, `1` and `123` are neither
strings nor valid identifiers so a SyntaxError is raised.

Edit after running part of the code:

The above is wrong. Instead a ReferenceError is thrown for line 9 where the
name `a` is not defined. It isn't a variable or property of the global object.
